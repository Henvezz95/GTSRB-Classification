# GTSRB-Classification
Training a Convolutional Neural Network to perform multi-class classification on the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark.
It uses Data Augmentation (shear, rotation, translation, zoom, elastic transform, gaussian noise) to increase model accuracy.

```Best Accuracy: 98.62%```
